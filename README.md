cvds is an experimental library written using OpenCV and Python for detecting and warping recordings of LCD displays into higher quality, undistorted footage.

The initial motivation behind this project was to develop a real-time solution for portable console recording.

While there exist fundamental limitations of this approach (such as the nyquist rate in many cases, both spatially and temporally), the goal of cvds is to provide a tool to improve the quality of screen recordings with good enough consistency and quality to warrant its use as a viable postprocessing step.
